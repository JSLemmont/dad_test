   * About:
   *    JAXL stands for "Just Another XMPP Library"
   *    For geeks, JAXL stands for "Jabber XMPP Library"
   *    
   *    I wrote this library while developing Gtalkbots (http://gtalkbots.com)
   *    I have highly customized it to work with Gtalk Servers and inspite of
   *    production level usage at Gtalkbots, I recommend still not to use this
   *    for any live project.
   *    
   *    Feel free to add me in Gtalk and drop an IM.

   * ==================================== IMPORTANT =========================================
   * This is a sample application code showing the power of JAXL. How without knowing the
   * inner tit-bits of XMPP protocols you can develop cool applications.
   *
   * To run this sample application you need:
   * 1. JAXL Library version 1.0.4 or higher (http://code.google.com/p/jaxl)
   * 2. PHP Mailer Class (http://phpmailer.codeworxtech.com/)
